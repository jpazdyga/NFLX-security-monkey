## NFLX-security-monkey

#### What's the Monkey that cares about security?
Security Monkey monitors policy changes and alerts on insecure configurations in an AWS account. 
While Security Monkeyâ€™s main purpose is security, it also proves a useful tool for tracking down potential problems as it is essentially a change tracking system.

#### So, what this docker container does?
This is a repository with Dockerfile and bootstrap scripts to get the Netflix' Security Monkey up.
Still, you'll need to prepare you AWS environment to be able to use it.

The source for this Dockerfile is located here: ```http://securitymonkey.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html```
